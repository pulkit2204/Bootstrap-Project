                    A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof andwalls standing more or less permanently
                    in one place, such as a house or factory.Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions,
                     and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available,
                      to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better
                       understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.

                        Buildings serve several societal needs â€“ primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, 
                        privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a 
                        physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that 
                        at times may be harsh and harmful).
                        Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression.
                        In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of
                        the design process of many new buildings.
